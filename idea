This project is a simple Red Team assistant agent for basic reconnaissance.
It automates the first step of red teaming: gathering information about a target domain.

What it does

WHOIS Lookup → collects registration details (registrar, creation/expiration dates, name servers, emails).

Certificate Transparency Search (crt.sh) → extracts possible subdomains from public certificates.

DNS Resolution → checks which subdomains resolve to valid IP addresses.

Result Saving → stores everything in a structured JSON file inside a results/ folder.

Why it’s useful

Automates repetitive recon steps.

Gives a clean JSON output that can be reused by other tools.

Lightweight and easy to run locally.

How it works (flow)

Input: a domain name (e.g., example.com).

Run WHOIS → normalize the data.

Query crt.sh for subdomains.

Resolve each subdomain to IPs (DNS A records).

Save results to results/domain_recon_<timestamp>.json.
